# Stripe Embedded Checkout Integration

This document explains the new Stripe Embedded Checkout integration that has been added to the Maids of CyFair application.

## Overview

The application now uses Stripe's Embedded Checkout instead of the previous custom payment forms. This provides a more secure and streamlined payment experience.

## What's New

### Backend Changes

1. **New Endpoint**: `/api/create-checkout-session`
   - Creates a Stripe checkout session for embedded checkout
   - Returns a client secret for the frontend to use
   - Handles booking validation and pricing

### Frontend Changes

1. **New Component**: `StripeEmbeddedCheckout.js`
   - Uses the provided Stripe embedded checkout code
   - Handles payment success/error events
   - Provides a clean, secure payment interface

2. **Updated Component**: `PaymentPage.js`
   - Now uses `StripeEmbeddedCheckout` instead of the old `StripeCheckout`
   - Maintains the same interface for seamless integration

## Key Features

- **Secure Payment Processing**: Uses Stripe's embedded checkout for maximum security
- **Real-time Validation**: Immediate feedback on payment status
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works seamlessly on all devices
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

## Usage

### For Developers

The embedded checkout is automatically used when users navigate to the payment page:

```javascript
// The PaymentPage component now uses StripeEmbeddedCheckout
<StripeEmbeddedCheckout
  bookingData={bookingData}
  onPaymentSuccess={handlePaymentSuccess}
  onPaymentError={handlePaymentError}
/>
```

### For Users

1. Navigate to the payment page for any booking
2. The embedded Stripe checkout form will load automatically
3. Enter payment details securely
4. Complete the payment with real-time validation

## Configuration

### Stripe Keys

The integration uses the provided test key:
```javascript
const stripe = loadStripe("pk_test_51RzKQdRps3Ulo01CKof4M3aPKgizeI6LEFLs3hvVPj0wBS5rqYqAD2VgmELzDSoFkBJ8MLuLIdNoySlBeBIYWJMt00lR0w67");
```

### Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in your `.env` file:
- `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL`: Backend server URL
- `REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: Stripe publishable key (optional, uses provided key as fallback)

## Testing

To test the integration:

1. **Start the backend server**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   source env/bin/activate
   python server.py
   ```

2. **Start the frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

3. **Navigate to a payment page** to see the embedded checkout in action

## Security Features

- **PCI Compliance**: Stripe handles all sensitive payment data
