3. Navigate to Amazon SES service

#### Step 2: Verify Email Domain

2. Create a new user with programmatic access
3. Attach the `AmazonSESFullAccess` policy
4. Save the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key

#### Step 4: Request Production Access (Optional)

- To send to any email address, request production access
- Go to SES console â†’ Account dashboard â†’ Request production access

### 2. Environment Configuration

#### Backend Environment Variables
Add these variables to your `.env` file in the backend directory:

```bash
# AWS SES Configuration
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key_id_here
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_access_key_here
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@maidsofcyfair.com
FROM_NAME=Maids of CyFair
```

#### Frontend Environment Variables
No additional frontend configuration needed - the email reminders are integrated into the existing admin dashboard.

### 3. Install Dependencies

The required dependencies are already included in `requirements.txt`:
- `boto3>=1.34.129` - AWS SDK for Python

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Emails Not Sending
- Check AWS credentials in environment variables
- Verify your domain is verified in SES
- Check AWS SES sending limits
- Ensure you're not in sandbox mode (if sending to unverified emails)

#### 2. "No Email Available" Status
- This means the customer doesn't have an email address in the system
- Check if the booking was made by a guest user
- Verify the user's email in the user management section

#### 3. AWS SES Errors
- Check AWS CloudWatch logs for detailed error messages
- Verify IAM permissions for the SES user
- Ensure the region matches your SES setup

### Debugging Steps
1. Check the backend logs for error messages
2. Verify AWS credentials are correct
3. Test with a single email first
4. Check SES console for bounce/complaint rates

## Security Considerations

### AWS Security
- Use IAM roles with minimal required permissions
- Rotate access keys regularly
- Monitor SES usage and costs
- Set up CloudWatch alarms for unusual activity

### Email Security
- Never hardcode credentials in the code
- Use environment variables for all sensitive data
- Implement rate limiting for email sending
- Monitor bounce and complaint rates

## Cost Considerations

### AWS SES Pricing
- First 62,000 emails per month are free (if sent from EC2)
- After that: $0.10 per 1,000 emails
- Additional charges for attachments or data transfer

### Optimization Tips
- Use batch sending to reduce API calls
- Implement email validation before sending
- Monitor bounce rates to maintain good sender reputation
- Use appropriate reminder timing to avoid spam complaints
