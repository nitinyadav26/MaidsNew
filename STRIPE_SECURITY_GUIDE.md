# Stripe Payment Integration - Security Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented for the Stripe payment integration in the Maids of Cyfair booking system.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Backend Security

#### Input Validation
- **Card Number Validation**: Luhn algorithm implementation for card number verification
- **CVC Validation**: 3-4 digit validation with proper format checking
- **Expiry Date Validation**: Future date validation with proper month/year checks
- **Sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized before processing

#### API Security
- **Authentication Required**: All payment endpoints require valid JWT tokens
- **User Authorization**: Users can only access their own payment methods and intents
- **Rate Limiting**: Implemented to prevent abuse (recommended: 10 requests/minute per IP)
- **HTTPS Only**: All payment data transmission over encrypted connections

#### Database Security
- **No Sensitive Data Storage**: Card details are never stored in our database
- **Stripe Customer IDs**: Only Stripe customer IDs and payment method references stored
- **Audit Trail**: All payment activities logged for security monitoring
- **Encrypted Connections**: MongoDB connections use encryption

### 2. Frontend Security

#### Stripe Elements
- **PCI Compliance**: Card data handled directly by Stripe Elements (PCI DSS compliant)
- **No Card Data Storage**: Card details never touch our servers
- **Secure Tokenization**: Payment methods tokenized by Stripe
- **Real-time Validation**: Client-side validation with Stripe's secure forms

#### Security Headers
- **Content Security Policy**: Implemented to prevent XSS attacks
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All payment pages require HTTPS
- **Secure Cookies**: JWT tokens stored in secure, HTTP-only cookies

### 3. Payment Flow Security

#### Payment Intent Security
- **Server-side Creation**: Payment intents created on backend only
- **Amount Validation**: Server validates payment amounts before processing
- **Idempotency**: Prevents duplicate payments with unique keys
- **Webhook Verification**: Stripe webhook signatures verified for authenticity

#### Fraud Prevention
- **3D Secure**: Automatic 3D Secure authentication for high-risk transactions
- **Risk Assessment**: Stripe's built-in fraud detection and risk scoring
- **Velocity Checks**: Prevents rapid-fire payment attempts
- **Geolocation**: Optional location-based fraud detection

### 4. Webhook Security

#### Signature Verification
```python
# Webhook signature verification
event = stripe.Webhook.construct_event(
    payload, sig_header, STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
)
```

#### Event Processing
- **Idempotent Processing**: Duplicate webhook events handled safely
- **Event Validation**: Only process expected event types
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of webhook processing errors

### 5. Environment Security

#### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required environment variables
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...  # Production key
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...  # Production key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...  # Webhook endpoint secret
```

#### Key Management
- **Separate Keys**: Different keys for test and production environments
- **Key Rotation**: Regular rotation of API keys (recommended: quarterly)
- **Access Control**: Limited access to production keys
- **Monitoring**: API key usage monitoring and alerting

### 6. Compliance & Standards

#### PCI DSS Compliance
- **Level 1 Compliance**: Stripe is PCI DSS Level 1 compliant
- **No Card Data**: We never store, process, or transmit card data
- **Secure Transmission**: All data encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Regular Audits**: Annual security audits and penetration testing

#### Data Protection
- **GDPR Compliance**: User data handling follows GDPR guidelines
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect necessary payment information
- **Right to Deletion**: Users can delete payment methods and data
- **Data Encryption**: All sensitive data encrypted at rest

### 7. Monitoring & Alerting

#### Security Monitoring
- **Failed Payment Tracking**: Monitor and alert on failed payment attempts
- **Suspicious Activity**: Alert on unusual payment patterns
- **API Usage**: Monitor Stripe API usage for anomalies
- **Error Rates**: Track and alert on high error rates

#### Logging
- **Audit Logs**: All payment activities logged with timestamps
- **Security Events**: Failed authentications and suspicious activities
- **Payment Events**: Successful and failed payment attempts
- **Error Tracking**: Detailed error logging for debugging

### 8. Testing & Validation

#### Security Testing
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular security assessments
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection
- **Code Review**: Security-focused code reviews
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular security updates for dependencies

#### Payment Testing
- **Test Cards**: Use Stripe test cards for development
- **Webhook Testing**: Test webhook handling with Stripe CLI
- **Error Scenarios**: Test all error conditions and edge cases
- **Load Testing**: Ensure system handles high payment volumes

## Best Practices

### Development
1. **Never log sensitive data** (card numbers, CVC, etc.)
2. **Use environment variables** for all secrets
3. **Validate all inputs** on both client and server
4. **Handle errors gracefully** without exposing system details
5. **Test thoroughly** with Stripe test cards

### Production
1. **Use HTTPS everywhere** for payment pages
2. **Monitor payment success rates** and error patterns
3. **Keep dependencies updated** for security patches
4. **Regular security reviews** of payment code
